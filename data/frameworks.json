So we tried it, not even mentioned we have the OKR system, so it is actually a very good learning from our early stage from Google.  So all these, I think definitely we do have some of the, I would say, benefits being the newcomer to the market and then learn a lot of the best practices coming from our industry peers and really deployed here hopefully successfully. \r\n\r\n(00:29:53):\r\nAnd some of the things that we just tweaked",

Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it.

And what you're saying here is you barely spend any time on activation because in a company like Lovable, there's a prompt, you give it what you want, it generates a thing, and that's basically all it is.

          "# Building high-performing teams | Melissa Tan (Webflow, Dropbox, Canva)\r\n\r\n## Transcript\r\n\r\nMelissa Tan (00:00:00):\r\nMy aha moment of the value of first principles thinking was when I was at Dropbox.  We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales.  There are a lot of disadvantages to that, but I do think it led to a ton of innovation",
          "Lenny (01:08:06):\r\nIs there an example of a person or moment or question that comes to mind of this is an epitome of a first principles thinker moment or question or a way of approaching something. \r\n\r\nMelissa Tan (01:08:17):\r\nMy aha moment of the value of first principles thinking was when I was at Dropbox and we had the most unconventional people on our initial sales team.  Dropbox was known for this.  We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales",
          "\" Versus someone that think they know all the answers, limits you into what you are going to do.  And so my aha moment was really at Dropbox seeing so many times people that had never done these things and then seeing so much innovation come as a result of that. \r\n\r\nLenny (01:09:51):\r\nThat is an awesome story.  Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to or very exciting lightning round"

So in the activation process, we have set up moments, aha moments and habit moments and our habit moments that we define as a team being activated, it's related to fixing vulnerabilities within 30 days of team creation.  And the reason that is chosen, it's because there is a significant correlation with downstream.  And in that case with activation three month retention and retention again based on, again, not just coming back and logging in but still fixing",

What's the setup moment and what are the individual steps that the team needs to go through to reach that set up moment.  So that's the overall process and ultimately it's a really strong model that allows us then to feed in the set of user level behaviors that we know can influence those different steps on that path to activation"

I feel like maybe less eloquently I deduced some of the same principles just in my own experience, which is I think when you're scaling up, and this relates also to what we talked about before around the early days of building a company, you're in the details, you're finding product market fit, you kind of have to be pretty versatile, right.  All these decisions from a technical standpoint to design, to even commercial, and what's the freemium model going to be like",

          "There is a world where you are so in the details and in every detail that you're basically just micromanaging and you're kind of creating like a euphemism for that.  That's not really what founder mode is about.  That's not like the Brian conception of founder mode is to like micromanage everything and not trust anyone, but I think it's more about finding that right balance of being unabashed about caring about the details that do matter and where the tying together of details across different groups or departments actually is the only way to yield a non-incremental outcome.  Otherwise, each person is just optimizing within their own domain, but you'll never get to the global maxima or the global breakthrough"
